title: Automatic bag carrier
---

Imagine an automated shopping assistant that follows you around with your bags and clothing. Basically a coat rack on an [iRobot roomba](http://www.irobot.com/For-the-Home/Vacuum-Cleaning/Roomba.aspx), just a bit smarter. We shall call it: **The Automatic Bag Carrier** or ABC.

This would especially be useful in the winter - it gets pretty hot during those Black Friday fights (Epic Black Friday 2015 fight compilation video inside).

A low budget version of this is a regular coat rack on wheels, although it probably won't follow you far ;).

Happy shopping!
