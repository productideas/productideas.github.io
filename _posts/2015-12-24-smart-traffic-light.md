title: A smart traffic light
---

You know those traffic lights with a progress bar? I don't know if they exists at all in real life, but lets imagine they do. If they don't, every traffic light is probably connected to a central timer so it's plausible to add a sound sensor to each of them.

Wouldn't it be cool if you could blow your car horn to speed it up a bit? This would be crowd powered of course because everyone would do it while waiting.
